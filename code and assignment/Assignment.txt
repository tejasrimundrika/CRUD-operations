Assignment:
Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

What is a Data Type?
A data type defines the type of data that a variable can hold in a programming language. It specifies the kind of operations that can be performed on the data. Data types are crucial for ensuring the correctness of a program, as they define the format, size, and range of values a variable can store.

Types of Data Types:
Primitive Data Types
Non-Primitive Data Types

1. Primitive Data Types
-->These are the most basic types of data and can store single values.
-->Predefined by the programming language.
-->Simple and fundamental.
Examples:
String
Number
Boolean
Undefined
Null
-->String:- sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes / single quotes / backticks(``).
Example:
let name = "Alice";      
let greeting = 'Hello';  
let message = `Welcome, ${name}!`; 
console.log(message);    
Output: Welcome, Alice!

-->Number:-it sotres all the number data types such as integer , float values etc...
Example:
let age = 25;           
let price = 99.99;      
console.log(age + price); 
Output: 124.99

-->Boolean :-true/false, useful for conditional statements
Example:
let isStudent = true;
let hasAccess = false;
if (isStudent) {
    console.log("You have access!");
}

-->Undefined:- any variable decalred but not intitialized.
Example:
let salary;
console.log(salary); 
Output: undefined

-->Null:- empty of object.
Example:
let user = null;
console.log(user);
Output: null

2. Non-Primitive Data Types
-->These are more complex data types that can store multiple values.
-->Created by the user.
-->Capable of holding collections of data or complex entities.
Examples:
Functions
Arrays
Objects

-->Functions:-A block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task.Can accept parameters and return results.
Example:
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("Alice")); 
Output: Hello, Alice!

-->Arrays:- A collection of elements, which can be of the same or different types.Elements are accessed using an index (starting at 0).
Example:
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]);
Output: Apple

-->Objects:-A collection of key-value pairs.Each key is unique and maps to a specific value.
Example:
let car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: 2022
};
console.log(car.brand);
Output: Toyota
